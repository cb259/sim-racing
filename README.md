## How I use it all
All of this currently lives in my home office, which pulls double duty: A work from home setup during the week and a gaming room during the weekend. To facilitate this, the monitor is on an ergo-arm mounted to my desk and I swing the monitor out and to the left for sim racing to align with my wheel stand and get the monitor closer to my eyes. 

# Upgrade Path
The sim-racing equipment above represents my first entry into the hobby. As such, I was trying to balance experience with cost because I did not know if I was going to stick with it. Several months in, I thoroughly enjoy the hobby and see no end in sight. I have started to notice shortcomings of my current setup. The sections below detail the problems and my current plans to address them.

## The Problems
1. Sound - The desk speakers provide good sound, but the left speaker is blocked when my office is in sim racing mode.
2. Seating - Given my budget and dual-nature of my office I am using my office chair for seating. Flex is noticeable during breaking and my seating position leaves a lot to be desired.
3. Stand - The NLR wheel stand 2.0 was a great choice and is sturdy enough for my intended purpose. Combined with my poor seating position I am noticing the flex and other issues under hard braking.
4. Setup & Breakdown - Although the stand is meant to be moved around moving it with the wheelbase and pedals attached is a PITA (Removing the base and pedals would be a bigger PITA). The setup & breakdown process also makes me less likely to have a practice session or quick race during the week due to the time involved and PITA factor.
5. Space - My office is not very big (10' x 10'). When I have the entire RIG running the heat buildup in the room is noticeable. This is not as bad in the winter as the heat is welcome, but is less tolerable in the warmer months.

## The Solutions
1. Sound - I believe I can get a better experience with a headset. This would also have the benefit of providing a microphone for voice chat.
2. Seating - A proper racing seat is required. More research to come here, but I would prefer one that is slider mounted for adjustability. I am on the fence about a fixed or adjustable back. I have concerns about the rigidity of an adjustable back, long term.

3. Stand - The wheel stand will be replaced with a full extruded aluminum chassis. I considered adding the expansion to the NLR wheelstand 2.0 that would provide an attached seat mount to solve the stand and seating problems in one shot. However, after doing that I would have spent roughly what an aluminum chassis costs, and my not have addressed all of my issues.

4. Setup & Breakdown - There is a short-term and long-term view. Long-term I have dedicated sim racing chassis (Including monitor and computer) so I no longer need to setup or breakdown anything. Short-term, I am going to need to continue to share some components for work, sim racing and other gaming. I'm looking into having the chassis and seat on wheels so I can quickly roll it in and out as needed.
5. Space - Long term, with a dedicated sim rig, I will likely move it out of office and into another spot.
