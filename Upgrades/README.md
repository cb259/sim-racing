Sim Racing Rig Upgrades

# Monitor Stand & Monitor
Goal: Procure a seperate monitor and monitor stand to make the sim rig independant of the general compute workstation.

# Principles
1. Continue to use a single ultrawide monitor.
2. The entire rig must fit in the right side of the current room.
3. The sim rig computer will be colocated with the rig.
4. The setup should work as other components of the rig are upgraded.
